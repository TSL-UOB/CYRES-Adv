% Meeting Notes:
% ##############
% Peter keen to report Online test generation 
% Find a problem (based on warwick), auto gen test cases and run sim, check to see if it made it less stable (eg. actuator) 
% State what we are doing, demonstrate principle for our test case then show how this applies to cyres 
% What properties does Warwick use that we can link - "this suggests property X is too low" 
% More from the conclusions of work already done  
% Assertion testing fails wrt resources, threading, software behaves differently 
% Digital twin lacking in fidelity 
% Lacing the 'what this data' means 
% AI test paper, det paper, assertions, ana's thesis 
% What does this mean and why does it work 
% Report and video 
% Join our stuff with Jitsuin ledger 
% Add References, anas thesis, koopman spy paper on safety, how to break brakes

Introduction
- lead-in, see how Peter/Thales wants us to lead into this body of work
- objectives, discuss the overaching picture and where we will fit in
- picture, maybe a good place for a picture to show schematically part of the pipeline

Process in detail
- Inputs, Discuss what Warwick will provide, what properties would be useful/available
- Processing, use simulation to infer behavourial change based on observed properties
- Ledger, how the ledger will be used to uniquely identify 
- Outputs, what will result from our part of the tool-chain

Automated Test Generation
- background, test generation methods available and which suitable to the cyres methodology
- how AI methods could be useful here and how they are applicable at scale
- use AI test paper for references

Deterministic Simulation
- These simulators used a lot for CAV testing (robopilot etc.)
- Resource utilisation, scheduling important
- Link back in to how ledger could be used

Automated/Online Assertion Checking
- CH work on how to infer improper behaviour from simulation data
- Database structure and key technologies used, how this is unique and supports cyres

Braking Brakes
- Ana's thesis work
- Can demonstrate real automotive architecture

Concept to CyRes
- Here we say how these concepts can be brought together for a unique CyRes opportunity
